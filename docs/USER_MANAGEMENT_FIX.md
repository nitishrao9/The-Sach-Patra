# User Management System Fix

## Issue Fixed

The user management system was previously using mock data and not properly saving users to Firebase Authentication and Firestore. Users would disappear on page refresh because they weren't actually being created in the database.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Firebase Integration**
- ✅ Added proper Firebase Authentication user creation
- ✅ Added Firestore user document creation
- ✅ Implemented real-time data loading from Firestore
- ✅ Added proper error handling for Firebase operations

### 2. **User Creation Process**
- ✅ Creates Firebase Auth user with email/password
- ✅ Updates user profile with display name
- ✅ Creates corresponding Firestore document with role information
- ✅ Handles duplicate email errors gracefully

### 3. **User Management Features**
- ✅ **Create Users**: Properly creates users in both Auth and Firestore
- ✅ **Edit Users**: Updates user information in Firestore
- ✅ **Delete Users**: Removes user documents from Firestore
- ✅ **Role Management**: Updates user roles with proper validation
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Refreshes data after operations

### 4. **UI Improvements**
- ✅ Loading states during operations
- ✅ Error display for failed operations
- ✅ Disabled states during submission
- ✅ Success feedback for completed operations

## How to Use

### Creating a New User

1. **Access User Management**
   - Login as an admin user
   - Navigate to `/admin/users`

2. **Add New User**
   - Click "Add User" button
   - Fill in the required information:
     - **Email**: User's email address (must be unique)
     - **Display Name**: User's full name
     - **Password**: Minimum 6 characters (required for new users)
     - **Role**: Select either "Editor" or "Admin"

3. **Submit**
   - Click "Create User"
   - Wait for confirmation
   - User will appear in the list

### Editing Existing Users

1. **Find User**: Locate the user in the table
2. **Edit**: Click the edit button (pencil icon)
3. **Update**: Modify display name or role
4. **Save**: Click "Update User"

**Note**: Email cannot be changed for existing users, and password updates are not supported through this interface.

### Managing User Roles

1. **Quick Role Change**: Use the dropdown in the user table
2. **Role Permissions**:
   - **Admin**: Full access to all features and user management
   - **Editor**: Can create and manage content, limited admin access

### Deleting Users

1. **Select User**: Find the user to delete
2. **Delete**: Click the delete button (trash icon)
3. **Confirm**: Confirm the deletion in the popup

**Important**: 
- You cannot delete your own account
- Deletion removes the Firestore document but not the Firebase Auth user
- This action cannot be undone

## Technical Details

### Database Structure

Users are stored in the `users` collection in Firestore:

```typescript
{
  id: string;           // Firebase Auth UID
  email: string;        // User's email
  displayName: string;  // User's display name
  role: 'admin' | 'editor';
  roleLevel: 1 | 2;     // 1 = admin, 2 = editor
  createdAt: Date;      // When user was created
  updatedAt: Date;      // Last update timestamp
}
```

### Security Rules

Ensure your Firestore security rules allow admins to read/write user documents:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Email already in use" Error**
   - The email is already registered in Firebase Auth
   - Use a different email address
   - Check if user already exists in the system

2. **"Permission denied" Error**
   - Ensure you're logged in as an admin
   - Check Firestore security rules
   - Verify your admin role in the database

3. **Users not appearing**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify Firestore connection
   - Ensure proper Firebase configuration

4. **Role changes not working**
   - Verify admin permissions
   - Check for network connectivity
   - Refresh the page and try again

### Best Practices

1. **User Creation**
   - Use strong passwords (minimum 6 characters)
   - Use descriptive display names
   - Assign appropriate roles based on user needs

2. **Role Management**
   - Regularly review user roles
   - Remove unnecessary admin privileges
   - Keep track of who has admin access

3. **Security**
   - Don't share admin credentials
   - Regularly audit user accounts
   - Remove inactive users

## Migration from Old System

If you had users created with the old mock system:

1. **Backup**: Export any important user data
2. **Clean Start**: The new system will load real users from Firestore
3. **Recreate**: Manually recreate any test users using the new system
4. **Verify**: Confirm all users have proper Firebase Auth accounts

## Support

For technical issues:
1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify Firebase project configuration
3. Ensure proper admin permissions
4. Contact system administrator if problems persist
